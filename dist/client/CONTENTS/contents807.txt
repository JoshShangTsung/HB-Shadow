Constructor's teleport ability
  
The constructor can teleport directly
to the middle land where the commander
set.

The actual teleport location is 
where the yellow mark is assigned.
If the the mark is not assigned
you can't teleport yet until
the commanders designation.

 
Clicking once again you can teleport
to the destination.


Normally, the commander sets the
teleport position near the mana stone,
and notices using the guild chat to
constructors and soldiers and at the
same time click the teleport button
and excecute the strategy.
