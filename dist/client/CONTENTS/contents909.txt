  
Crusade
     
The crusade system of helbreath is
realtime strategy system applied on
current base system of RPG MUG.
You can not find this system on the
other MUG.
 
The crusade is a portal war between
Elvine and Aresden. it happens about
twice a week. Once a crusade mode
began, it continues to the time
when one side win.
    
If the crusade breaks out, you
can decide your part in the town.
 
Most of all, people take part
soldier who fight the front.
If you have manufacturing skill,
you can do constructor who constructs
war building. 
 
If you are a guildmaster,
you can be a commander who
instruct your guildsman.
 
If you want to change your
part on crusade, you can
change it at cityhall.
   
The purpose of crusade is to
lead your country winner by
destroying enemy's base buildings.
These buildings are not destroyed
by people's normal attack.
 
To destroy enemy's buildings
operate the 'Grand Magic Generator'
that is located in your town.

To operate 'Grand Magic Generator'
you should collect mana of 'Mana
Stone' by constructing 'Mana
Collector' near 'Mana Stone'
in the middleland. 
 
'Mana Collector' is a war building
which collects the mana from the
'Mana Stone'. And the constructor
can construct this building.
 
If The mana charge of 'Grand
Magic Generator' is enough to
generate 'Metheo-Strike', it
attacks enemy's base building
by 'Metheo-Strike'.
 
By the blowing of magic, if
you destroy enemy's building,
the function of that building
will stop and the capability
of enemy for the crusade will
be decreased. And you can make
this crusade by destroying whole
the building.
 
With the crusade mode on,
'Energy Shield Generator' will
be installed near the base
buildings to protect them.
 
You can protect base buildings
from enemy's magic attack if
there are more than 1 'Energy
Shield Generator'. But if there
are less than 2, the base buildings
will have damage from the magic.
   
So, to make your nation winner,
infiltrate into enemy's nation
and destroy 'Energy Shield Generator'
and construct 'Mana Collector'
near the 'Mana Stone' in the
middleland to collect the
mana which is needed for magic.
