The constructor will be able to
construct the bay warfare building
in the location vicinity after the
commander sets. Before this you
can't construct it. There is a
yellow cruciform indication in the
middleland map and there will
be the construction location. 

A kit will appear on the bottom
after moving to the construction
location and selecting the building.
With a forced attack using the pickaxe,
the building will slowly be completed.
