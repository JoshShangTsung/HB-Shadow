Welcome to the Helbreath continent.
 
In this continent there are 
two great city nations. One is the nation 
of Aresden where the God Aresien is
worshiped and the other is the nation of 
Elvine which worships the God Elvine.
 
You will be teleported to the designated
nation depending on the symbol you step on.


For now, you are just a traveller who can 
freely pass through both nations.
However, after you chose a nationality
you will enter into a fierce battle
with the other side as Aresden and Elvine 
are at war with each another.

For more detailed instructions on the
game, refer to the 'Help Guide'(Help).
