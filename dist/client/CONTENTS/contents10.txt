An unforgettable never ending story
of Helbreath's continental war.
     
Welcome to the Helbreath's world!

In this continent there are two
great city nations. One is the
nation of Aresden where the God
Aresien is worshiped and the
nation of Elvine which worships
the God Eldiniel. Between of this
two continents is situated the mid-
dleland which is the battle field.

For now, you are just a wanderer
who can freely pass through both
nations. However, as you chose one
nationality you shall enter into
fierce battle either with Aresden
or Elvine who are in war against
one another. To take the citizen-
ship you must increase to a
certain level,then you will be able
to participate in the battle.

As a neutral citizen first, you
should level up in the beginner
zone hunting monsters. And there
is a portal that teleports you
depending on the continent you
belong.
 
If you want to be a legal citizen
of a country you must take the
citizenship in the cityhall. Then
you will be able to participate in
the battle.

Beforehand, after taking the
citizenship you become a legal
country citizen so the attack
from the enemy is allowed. So you
must prepare hardly for the attack
