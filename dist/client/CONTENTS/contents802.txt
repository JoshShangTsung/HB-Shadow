All out war outline 
  
At first when the battle starts,
you can decide your duty in the city.

In most case, your duty is
designated as a soldier at the front
If you have got the weapon manufacture
skill there is a possibility for you
to become a constructor.
 
If you are a guild master 
you could be a guild commander.

If You want to change your duty
go to cityhall.
 
   
The main purpose of the front battle
is to destroy principal buildings of
the enemy such as Cityhall, Warehouse,
Blacksmith,Shop leading to victory.
Normal users can't destroy the buildings.

To destroy enemy's buildings you must
activate the Grand Magic Generator 
situated in your country. 


In order to activate the Grand
magic generator you must find the
Mana Stone and build close to it
a Mana collector gathering Mana. 

 
Mana Collector is an energy
distributor that gathers the mana
and distributes to the Grand Magic
generator which is needed to make
it function. It's kind of rescue
material in the battle which is
made by the constructor.

When the Grand Mana Generator
is recharged with enogh energy
you will be albe to use 
the meteor-strike which can
destroy the enemy's buildings.


After destroying the buildings
with a continuous magic attack
it stops working decreasing the
attack, and if you destroy all
buildings you win.

 
When the battle starts in each 
of the two countries the Energy
shield generator is activated in
the principal buildings,
which defends the enemy's attack.
 
If 2 energy shield generator
are installed, you will be able to
defend perfectly from the enemies
attack but if there is only one,
your building will be damaged.
   
That is, if you want to lead your
country to victory, infiltrate the
enemy's country and destroy all
energy shield generators installing
a mana collector in the middleland
gathering enough mana to attack.
