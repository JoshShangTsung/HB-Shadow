Soldier's teleport ability 

The soldier can teleport directly
to the middleland after the
commander sets the position.
 
In the menu you will be able to
see a yellow mark in the middleland
map and that's the location.
If you can't see the yellow mark 
it means that the commander didn't 
set the location yet.

Clicking once again you will be
teleported to the destination. 
 

Normally, the commander sets the
teleport position near the mana
stone, and notices using the guild
chat to the soldiers and at the
same time click the teleport
button and excecute the strategy.
