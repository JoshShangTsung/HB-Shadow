If you want to use magic, you
should learn magic before use it.
 
You can learn the magic at magic
tower in the town. But there are
some magic you can't learn at the
magic tower like 'Ice-Storm', 
'Mass-Fire-Strike', 'Bloody-Shock-

can get the magic manual from the
high level monster like Demon or Liche.
