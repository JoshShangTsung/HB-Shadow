Commander warfare recall skill

Depends on the activity and points of the
constructor the commander would be able
to recall warfare soldiers.

It recalls a unit to accompany the
commander who is burnt, the guard mode
which it protects Guard Mode which stays
from the place where it is recalled and
the hall where attacks the enemy whom
approaches to Hold Mode. 

It recalls a unit to respect, there must be
a recall point which the recall unit does
in necessity.


When the assigned guild soldier kills an
enemy or a warfare unit in the battle and
when the constructor completes the
construction of warfare building, there is
a possibility of getting a recall point.
