necklaces and clothes. To equip item,
Drag the item from the item inventory
to the character information window

release quipment, drag the item

keeper or Blacksmith keeper and
select 'Sell' menu.
 
If you want to exchange an item with
another player, drag the item to
the player and drop it. And select
'Exchange' menu.
 
If you die by an enemy or a
monster, you will lose some 
experience and items. To protect 
yourself from losing important
items, you should deposit items 
in the warehouse. To do this, go to
the warehouse in the town, and
give the item by drag-drop to the 
Warehouse Keeper. If you want
to get an item back from the
warehouse, click the warehouse
keeper and select 'Manage' menu.
Then you can see the item list
under deposit. Click the item
from the list to take it back.
 
A character can hold 50 items in
their bag, and can deposit 120 items
in the warehouse.
 
Also on 1 tile, you can drop 
12 items. But if you drop
more than 12 items, the server
will not remember the first item.
So be careful.
